# GoIT Cypress Automation Lesson Notes and Homeworks 

This repository is a comprehensive showcase of my end-to-end automation journey at GoIT. It follows a professional modular architecture, covering everything from basic UI testing to advanced concepts like POM, API, and CI/CD.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into logical modules to demonstrate a clear learning path:

### 🎓 01-Homeworks
- **HW-14:** Initial E2E test scenarios.
- **HW-15 (Page Object Model):** Advanced refactoring of previous E2E test scenarios into a professional POM architecture. This module demonstrates the transition from standard scripting to an encapsulated framework, utilizing Getter methods and Page Classes to enhance maintainability and decouple test logic from UI elements.
- **HW-16 to HW-19:** Upcoming homework assignments for API, Performance, CI/CD, and BDD.

### 📚 02-Lessons
- **01-Basics:** Understanding Cypress folder structure and E2E tests with basic commands.
- **02-Page-Object-Pattern:** Implementing scalable and maintainable test architecture.
- **03-API-Testing:** Testing backend endpoints and HTTP methods.
- **04-Performance:** Measuring web performance metrics with Cypress.
- **05-CI-CD:** Integrating tests into automated pipelines.
- **06-BDD-Testing:** Behavior-Driven Development with Cucumber integration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Framework:** Cypress (E2E)
- **Pattern:** Page Object Model (POM)
- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Version Control:** Git (Conventional Commits)
- **Methodology:** TDD & BDD

## 💡 Quality Insight
This project is built with **maintainability** in mind. By separating Page Objects from Test Scripts, we ensure that our automation suite remains robust and easy to update as the application evolves.
